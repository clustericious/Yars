=head1 VERSION

version 0.96

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % yars_fast_balance
 % yars_fast_balance --info

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Attempt to fix all files on this server.

Don't run this unless all disks and
servers are fully operational.

If they are not, then failures will be
expensive, and things won't get balanced.
