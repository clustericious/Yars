=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<NOTE>: Development for this tool is winding down, and L<Yars> will
probably be deprecated within the next couple of years.  Please contact
me ASAP if you depend on this tool.  Please see
L<https://github.com/clustericious/Yars/issues/31> for details.

Yars is a simple RESTful server for data storage.

Properly configured it provides consistent WRITE availability, and 
eventual READ availability.  Once files are written to the storage 
cluster they are immutable (new files can -- even with the same 
filename) can also be written to the cluster.

It allows files to be PUT and GET based on their md5 sums and filenames, 
and uses a distributed hash table to store the files across any number 
of hosts and disks.

Files are assigned to disks and hosts based on their md5s in the 
following manner :

The first N digits of the md5 are considered the "bucket" for a file.  
e.g. for N=2, 256 buckets are then distributed among the disks in 
proportion to the size of each disk.  The bucket distribution is done 
manually as part of the configuration (with the aid of an included tool, 
L<yars_generate_diskmap>).

The server is controlled with the command line tool L<yars>.

The basic operations of a running yars cluster are supporting requests 
of the form

 PUT http://$host/file/$filename
 GET http://$host/file/$md5/$filename
 HEAD http://$host/file/$md5/$filename
 GET http://$host/bucket_map

to store and retrieve files, where C<$host> may be any of the hosts in 
the cluster, C<$md5> is the md5 of the content, and C<$filename> is a 
filename for the content to be stored.  See L<Yars::Routes> for 
documentation of other routes.

Failover is handled in the following manner:

If the host to which a file is assigned is not available, then the file 
will be "stashed" on the filesystem for the host to which it was sent.  
If there is no space there, other hosts and disks will be tried until an 
available one is found.  Because of this failover mechanism, the "stash" 
must be checked whenever a GET request is handled. A successful GET will 
return quickly, but an unsuccessful one will take longer because all of 
the stashes on all of the servers must be checked before a "404 Not 
Found" is returned.

Another tool L<yars_fast_balance> is provided which takes files from 
stashes and returns them to their correct locations.

A client L<Yars::Client> is also available (in a separate distribution), 
for interacting with a yars server.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 simple single server configuration

This creates a single Yars server using hypnotoad with sixteen buckets.

Create a configuration file in C<~/etc/Yars.conf> with this content:

 ---
 
 # The first half of the configuration specifies the
 # generic Clustericious / web server settings for
 # the server
 start_mode : 'hypnotoad'
 url : http://localhost:9001
 hypnotoad :
   pid_file : <%= home %>/var/run/yars.pid
   listen :
      - http://localhost:9001
 
 # The rest defines the servers, disks and buckets
 # used by the Yars cluster.  In this single server
 # example, there is only one server and one disk
 servers :
 - url : http://localhost:9001
   disks :
     - root : <%= home %>/var/data/disk1
       buckets : <%= json [ 0..9, 'a'..'f' ] %>

The configuration file is a L<Mojo::Template> template with helpers 
provided by L<Clustericious::Config::Helpers>.

Create the directories needed for the server:

 % mkdir -p ~/var/run ~/var/data

Now you can start the server process

 % yars start

=head3 check status

Now verify that it works:

 % curl http://localhost:9001/status
 {"server_url":"http://localhost:9001","server_version":"1.11","app_name":"Yars","server_hostname":"iscah"}

You can also verify that it works with L<yarsclient>:

 % yarsclient status
 ---
 app_name: Yars
 server_hostname: iscah
 server_url: http://localhost:9001
 server_version: '1.11'

Or via L<Yars::Client>:

 % perl -MYars::Client -MYAML::XS=Dump -E 'say Dump(Yars::Client->new->status)'
 ---
 app_name: Yars
 server_hostname: iscah
 server_url: http://localhost:9001
 server_version: '1.11'

=head3 upload and downloads

Now try storing a file:

 % echo "hi" | curl -D headers.txt -T - http://localhost:9001/file/test_file1
 ok
 % grep Location headers.txt 
 Location: http://localhost:9001/file/764efa883dda1e11db47671c4a3bbd9e/test_file1

You can use the Location header to fetch the file at a later time

 % curl http://localhost:9001/file/764efa883dda1e11db47671c4a3bbd9e/test_file1
 hi

With L<yarsclient>

 % echo "hi" > test_file2
 % md5sum test_file2
 764efa883dda1e11db47671c4a3bbd9e  test_file2
 % yarsclient upload test_file2
 
 ... some time later ...
 
 % yarsclient downbload test_file2 764efa883dda1e11db47671c4a3bbd9e

You can see the HTTP requests and responses using the C<--trace> option:

 % yarsclient --trace upload test_file2
 % yarsclient --trace download test_file2 764efa883dda1e11db47671c4a3bbd9e

And from Perl:

 use 5.010;
 use Yars::Client;
 use Digest::MD5 qw( md5_hex );
 
 my $y = Yars::Client->new;
 
 # filename as first argument,
 # reference to content as second argument
 $y->upload("test_file3", \"hi\n");
 
 # you can also skip the content like this:
 # $y->upload("test_file3");
 # to upload content from a local file
 
 my $md5 = md5_hex("hi\n");
 
 $y->download("test_file3", $md5);

=head2 Multiple servers

=head3 set up the URL

When configuring a cluster of several hosts, the C<url> value in the 
configuration must have the correct hostname or IP address for each host 
that the server is running on.  One way to handle this would be to have 
a configuration file for each host:

 ---
 # ~/etc/Yars.conf on yars1
 url: http://yars1:9001

 ---
 # ~/etc/Yars.conf on yars2
 url: http://yars2:9001

A less tedious way is to use the C<hostname> or C<hostname_full> helper 
from L<Clustericious::Config::Helpers>.  This allows you to use the same 
configuration for all servers in the cluster:

 ---
 # works for yars1, yars2 but not for
 # a client host
 url: http://<%= hostname %>:9001

=head3 abstract the webserver configuration

If you have multiple L<Clustericious> services on the same host, or if 
you share configurations between multiple hosts, it may be useful to use 
the <%= extends_config %> helper and put the web server configuration in 
a separate file.  For example:

 ---
 # ~/etc/Yars.conf
 % my $url = "http://" . hostname . ":9001";
 url: <%= $url %>
 % extends_config 'hypnotoad', url => $url, name => 'yars';

 ---
 # ~/etc/hypnotoad.conf
 hypnotoad :
   pid_file : <%= home %>/var/run/<%= $name %>.pid
   listen :
      - <%= $url %>

Now if you were also going to use L<PlugAuth> on the same host they 
could share the same C<hypnotoad.conf> file with different parameters:

 ---
 # ~/etc/PlugAuth.conf
 % my $url = "http://" . hostname . ":3001";
 url: <%= $url %>
 % extends_config 'hypnotoad', url => $url, name => 'plugauth';

=head3 generate the disk map

Given a file with a list of hosts and disks like this called diskmap.txt:

 yars1 /disk/1a
 yars1 /disk/1b
 yars2 /disk/2a
 yars2 /disk/2b
 yars3 /disk/3a
 yars3 /disk/3b

You can generate a disk map using the L<yars_generate_diskmap> command:

 % yars_generate_diskmap 2 diskmap.txt > ~/etc/yars_diskmap.conf

This will generate a diskmap configuration with the buckets evenly 
allocated to the available disks:

 ---
 servers :
 - url : http://yars1:9001
   disks :
   - root : /disk/1a
     buckets : [ 00, 06, 0c, 12, 18, 1e, 24, 2a, 30, 36, 3c, 42, 48,
                 4e, 54, 5a, 60, 66, 6c, 72, 78, 7e, 84, 8a, 90, 96, 9c,
                 a2, a8, ae, b4, ba, c0, c6, cc, d2, d8, de, e4, ea, f0,
                 f6, fc ]
   - root : /disk/1b
     buckets : [ 01, 07, 0d, 13, 19, 1f, 25, 2b, 31, 37, 3d, 43, 49,
                 4f, 55, 5b, 61, 67, 6d, 73, 79, 7f, 85, 8b, 91, 97, 9d,
                 a3, a9, af, b5, bb, c1, c7, cd, d3, d9, df, e5, eb, f1,
                 f7, fd ]
 - url : http://yars2:9001
   disks :
   - root : /disk/2a
     buckets : [ 02, 08, 0e, 14, 1a, 20, 26, 2c, 32, 38, 3e, 44, 4a,
                 50, 56, 5c, 62, 68, 6e, 74, 7a, 80, 86, 8c, 92, 98, 9e,
                 a4, aa, b0, b6, bc, c2, c8, ce, d4, da, e0, e6, ec, f2,
                 f8, fe ]
   - root : /disk/2b
     buckets : [ 03, 09, 0f, 15, 1b, 21, 27, 2d, 33, 39, 3f, 45, 4b,
                 51, 57, 5d, 63, 69, 6f, 75, 7b, 81, 87, 8d, 93, 99, 9f,
                 a5, ab, b1, b7, bd, c3, c9, cf, d5, db, e1, e7, ed, f3,
                 f9, ff ]
 - url : http://yars3:9001
   disks :
   - root : /disk/3a
     buckets : [ 04, 0a, 10, 16, 1c, 22, 28, 2e, 34, 3a, 40, 46, 4c,
                 52, 58, 5e, 64, 6a, 70, 76, 7c, 82, 88, 8e, 94, 9a, a0,
                 a6, ac, b2, b8, be, c4, ca, d0, d6, dc, e2, e8, ee, f4,
                 fa ]
   - root : /disk/3b
     buckets : [ 05, 0b, 11, 17, 1d, 23, 29, 2f, 35, 3b, 41, 47, 4d,
                 53, 59, 5f, 65, 6b, 71, 77, 7d, 83, 89, 8f, 95, 9b, a1,
                 a7, ad, b3, b9, bf, c5, cb, d1, d7, dd, e3, e9, ef, f5,
                 fb ]

which you can now extend from the Yars.conf file:

 ---
 # ~/etc/Yars.conf
 % my $url = "http://" . hostname . ":9001";
 url: <%= $url %>
 % extends_config 'hypnotoad', url => $url, name => 'yars';
 % extends_config 'yars_diskmap';

Also, if for whatever reason you are unable to use the C<hostname> or 
C<hostname_full> helper in your C<Yars.conf> file, it helps to keep your 
diskmap configuration in a separate file that can be shared between the 
different Yars server configuration files.

You can now run C<yars start> on each host to start the servers. L<clad> 
may be useful for starting "yars start" on multiple hosts at once.

=head3 client configuration

If you are using the C<hostname> or C<hostname_full> helpers to generate 
the URL in the serve configuration, then you won't be able to share that 
configuration with client systems.  In addition you can specify one or 
more failover hosts for L<Yars::Client> and C<yarsclient> to use when 
the primary is not available:

 ---
 # ~/etc/Yars.conf on client systems
 url: http://yars2:9001
 failover_urls:
   - http://yars1:9001

=head3 randomizing the server choices

In order to more evenly spread the load over each node in the Yars 
cluster, you can randomize the servers that the client considers the 
"primary" and the "failover(s)":

 ---
 # ~/etc/Yars.conf on client systems
 % use List::Util qw( shuffle );
 % my @url = shuffle map { "http://yars$_:9001" } 1..3;
 url: <%= $url[0] %>
 failover_urls:
   - <%= $url[1] %>

=head2 Accelerated downloads with nginx

One of the advantages of Clustericious is that it integrates with a 
number of different webservers.  You can do testing with hypnotoad, 
which comes with L<Mojolicious> (and thus a prerequisite of 
L<Clustericious> and Yars), and then deploy to production with a more 
capable webserver, such as nginx.  The integration with nginx allows for 
handing off some of the workload to nginx; hypnotoad is good for serving 
dynamic web applications, but nginx is better for serving static files.  
So with this next configuration we will show you how to configure Yars 
to handle the selection of servers and disks and hand off the actual 
serving of the static file to nginx.

Once again we put the nginx configuration in its own file so that we can 
reuse it with other L<Clustericious> services.

 ---
 # ~/etc/nginx.conf
 start_mode:
   - hypnotoad
   - nginx
 
 # we use hypnotoad to server the dynamic part of the app
 # and listen to the same port on localhost
 hypnotoad:
   listen:
     - http://127.0.0.1:<%= $port %>
   pid_file: <%= home %>/var/run/<%= $name %>-hypnotoad.pid
   proxy: 1
 
 # and we proxy requests on the main IP address through
 # nginx
 nginx:
   '-p': <%= home %>/var/run/<%= $name %>-nginx
   '-c': <%= home %>/var/run/<%= $name %>-nginx/conf/nginx.conf
   autogen:
     filename: <%= home %>/var/run/<%= $name %>-nginx/conf/nginx.conf
     content: |
         # autogenerated file
         events {
           worker_connections 4096;
         }
         http {
           server {
             listen <%= hostname %>:<%= $port %>;
             location / {
               proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:<%= $port %>;
               proxy_http_version 1.1;
 % if($name eq 'yars') {
               # to accelerate downloads, for Yars only
               # we set the X-Yars-Use-X-Accel header to
               # any value.  This will trigger Yars to
               # use nginx's X-Accel-Redirect to serve
               # actual static files back to the client.
               proxy_set_header X-Yars-Use-X-Accel yes;
 % }
             }
 % if($name eq 'yars') {
             # we need to make the static files available
             # to nginx.  The /static prefix is to ensure
             # that routes (future and present) do not
             # conflict with physical files on your disk.
             location /static/disk/ {
               # internal makes sure that these files
               # won't be served to external clients
               # without going through the yars interface
               internal;
               alias /disk/;
             }
 % }
           }
         }

and once again, our C<Yars.conf> file is short and sweet:

 ---
 % my $port = 9001;
 url: http://<%= hostname %>:<%= $port %>
 % extends_config 'nginx', port => $port, name => 'yars';
 % extends_config 'yars_diskmap';

If you are storing large files in your Yars cluster the nginx default 
maximum request size will probably not be adequate.  If you see an error 
message like this:

 % yarsclient upload large-file.iso
 [ERROR] 2016/09/30 11:23:48 Command.pm (204) (413) Request Entity Too Large

Then you need to set
L<client_max_body_size|http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size>
appropriately.

 http {
   server {
     client_max_body_size 0; # zero for no max
     ...
 
=head2 Accelerate by not checking the md5 twice

By default, Yars checks the MD5 of files before serving them to the 
client.  L<Yars::Client> and L<yarsclient> both also check the MD5 sum 
after downloading.  This saves bandwidth if automated processes attempt 
to redownload the same file if it is corrupted on the disk of the 
server. The chance of error is likely much higher on the network than it 
is on the disk, and if you prefer to do the check just on the client 
side, then you can use set the download_md5_verify to zero.

 ---
 % my $port = 9001;
 url: http://<%= hostname %>:<%= $port %>
 % extends_config 'nginx', port => $port, name => 'yars';
 % extends_config 'yars_diskmap';
 download_md5_verify: 0

When you download files with other clients like C<curl> or C<wget>, the 
MD5 check will still happen on the server side.  You may request this 
check be skipped by setting the C<X-Yars-Skip-Verify> header to any 
value.
